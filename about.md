# **Who We Are**

We are a passionate team of professionals dedicated to revolutionizing the summer camp experience. With backgrounds in education, child psychology, risk management, and diversity advocacy, our team brings a diverse range of expertise to the table. We are united by a shared commitment to ensuring that every child has access to a safe, inclusive, and enriching camp environment.

Driven by our belief in the transformative power of summer camp, we founded BetterCamps to address the critical need for comprehensive policies and support within the camping industry. Our collective experience working with camps of all sizes and specialties informs our approach, allowing us to tailor our resources and services to meet the unique needs of each organization.

As advocates for positive change, we are continually seeking new ways to improve camp policies and practices. Whether through research, collaboration, or advocacy efforts, we are dedicated to advancing the cause of camp safety and inclusivity at every opportunity.

At BetterCamps, we are more than just consultants or educators â€“ we are allies, partners, and champions for camps and campers alike. Join us in our mission to create a better, safer, and more inclusive camp experience for all.

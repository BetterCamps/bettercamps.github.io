# **Inclusivity Statement**  


We are open to children and teenagers with a focus toward building a community for children from atheist, agnostic, humanist, and other freethinking families. Our goal is to provide a place where children can explore their developing worldviews, ask questions, and make friends in an environment that is supportive of critical thinking and skepticism.

In alignment with our humanist values, we believe that we are all made better by celebrating difference, cooperatively learning from one another, practicing empathy, and questioning cultural constructions that are designed to exclude individuals. For these reasons, we are committed to providing youth with a safe, non-judgmental, bully-free environment that embraces human diversity and makes every reasonable effort to be inclusive. 

We welcome and affirm LGBTQIA2S+ campers and staff, and we support the ability of campers and staff to use pronouns that align with their gender identity. We further affirm the right of all people to be treated with respect and encouraged to understand and accept others regardless, and we seek to include anyone and everyone including but not limited to LGBTQIA2S+ individuals, individuals with disabilities, medical conditions, or dietary restrictions, and families experiencing poverty or homelessness. 

Our respectful, inclusive environment does not, however, prohibit disagreements, critiques, and debates over ideas as these are essential aspects of human discovery. People should be respected. Ideas should be questioned and debated using evidence. With those with whom one disagrees, we value constructive, respectful engagement about ideas, evidence-based conclusions, empathy, and engaged coexistence.

While driven by our philosophical desire to accommodate all youth, we remain a small organization in which factors such as supervision ratios, host camp facilities, financial resources, and available medical support may practically limit our ability to accommodate every potential camper. We encourage parents to contact us to find out whether we can provide a positive and safe camp experience for their child. Indeed, parent-leader communication before camp is most essential for ensuring that we are prepared to support your camper in achieving a positive, empowering summer camp experience.

Finally, everyone here works hard to choose behaviors that are safe, healthy, responsible, respectful, and kind. Depending on each camp site, we have communally-abided rules for health and safety, then have a process to create community behavior guidelines.

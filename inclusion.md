# **Inclusivity Statement**  


We focus toward building a community for children from atheist, agnostic, humanist, and other freethinking families, but we are open to everyone. Our goal is to provide places where campers can explore their developing worldviews, ask questions, and make friends in an environment that is supportive of critical thinking and skepticism.

In alignment with our humanist values, we believe that we are all made better by celebrating difference, cooperatively learning from one another, practicing empathy, and questioning cultural constructions that are designed to exclude individuals. For these reasons, we are committed to providing youth with a safe, non-judgmental, bully-free environment that embraces human diversity and makes every reasonable effort to be inclusive. 

We welcome and affirm LGBTQIA2S+ campers and staff, and we support the ability of campers and staff to use pronouns that align with their gender identity. We further affirm the right of all people to be treated with respect and encouraged to understand and accept others regardless, and we seek to include anyone and everyone including but not limited to LGBTQIA2S+ individuals, individuals with disabilities, medical conditions, or dietary restrictions, and families experiencing poverty or homelessness. 

While our environment fosters respect and inclusivity, it also encourages open discussions, critiques, and debates on ideas, recognizing them as fundamental to human exploration. Upholding respect for individuals is paramount in our approach while ideas should be questioned and debated using evidence. We value engaging constructively and respectfully with those holding differing views, emphasizing discussions based on ideas, evidence-backed conclusions, empathy, and collaborative coexistence.

Finally, everyone here works hard to choose behaviors that are safe, healthy, responsible, respectful, and kind. Here, we have communally-abided rules for health and safety and a separate process for behavior management.
